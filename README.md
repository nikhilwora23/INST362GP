Project Statement:
Finding the right time to go to the gym can be challenging. Many students have a routine of going to the gym after they finish classes for the day or even before classes, however, this becomes problematic when many of our students finish class at the same time. â€‹The application will allow students and others to know what weight rooms, basketball courts, and other sport courts are being used live. The application may allow students and others to request reservations so they do not have to wait at the gym and can manage their time more accordingly so they can have rather efficient days.
Process:
We had ensured that our wireframes (or prototype) was able to support all the functionality we are going to ask our test-user to go through.
